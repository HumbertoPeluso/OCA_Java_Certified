    /*The correct answer is before catch finally done. Everything is normal up until line
35, when "before" is added. Line 36 throws a NullPointerException. Line 37 is skipped
    as Java goes straight to the catch block. Line 38 does catch the exception, and "catch" is
    added on line 39. Then line 40 throws a RuntimeException. The finally block runs after
    the catch regardless of whether an exception is thrown; it adds "finally" to result*/
