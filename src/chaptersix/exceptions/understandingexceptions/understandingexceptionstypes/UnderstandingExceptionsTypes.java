        their classname, which can be confusing.*/

        /*Error means something went so horribly wrong that your program should not attempt to
        recover from it. For example, the disk drive “disappeared.” These are abnormal conditions

        exceptions tend to be unexpected but not necessarily fatal. For example, accessing an invalid
