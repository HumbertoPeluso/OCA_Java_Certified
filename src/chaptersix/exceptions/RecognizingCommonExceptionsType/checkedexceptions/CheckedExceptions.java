    /*Checked exceptions have Exception in their hierarchy but not RuntimeException. They
    must be handled or declared. They can be thrown by the programmer or by the JVM.
    Common runtime exceptions include the following:
    FileNotFoundException Thrown programmatically when code tries to reference a fi le
    that does not exist
    IOException Thrown programmatically when there’s a problem reading or writing a fi le
    For the OCA exam, you only need to know that these are checked exceptions. Also keep
    in mind that FileNotFoundException is a subclass of IOException, although the exam will
    remind you of that fact if it comes up. You’ll see these two exceptions in more detail on the
    OCP exam.*/
