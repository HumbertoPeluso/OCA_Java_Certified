public class Varargs {
   /* When creating an array yourself, it looks like what we’ve seen thus far. When one is passed
    to your method, there is another way it can look. Here are three examples with a main()
    method:
    public static void main(String[] args)
    public static void main(String args[])
    public static void main(String... args) // varargs
    The third example uses a syntax called varargs (variable arguments), which you saw in
    Chapter 1. You’ll learn how to call a method using varargs in Chapter 4, “Methods and
    Encapsulation.” For now, all you need to know is that you can use a variable defi ned using
    varargs as if it were a normal array. For example args.length and args[0] are legal.*/
