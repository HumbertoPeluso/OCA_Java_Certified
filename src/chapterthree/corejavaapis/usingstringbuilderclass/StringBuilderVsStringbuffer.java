   /* When writing new code that concatenates a lot of String objects together, you should
    use StringBuilder. StringBuilder was added to Java in Java 5. If you come across older
    code, you will see StringBuffer used for this purpose. StringBuffer does the same thing
    but more slowly because it is thread safe. You’ll learn about threads for the OCP exam. In
    theory, you don’t need to know about StringBuffer on the exam at all. However, we bring
this up anyway, since an older question might still be left on the exam.*/
