/*Not all questions will include the imports. If the exam isn’t asking about imports in the
        question, it will often omit the imports to save space. You’ll see examples with line numbers
        that don’t begin with 1 in this case. The question is telling you, “Don’t worry—imagine
        the code we omitted is correct; just focus on what I’m giving you.” This means when you
        do see the line number 1 or no line numbers at all, you have to make sure imports aren’t
        missing. Another thing the exam does to save space is to merge code on the same line. You
        should expect to see code like the following and to be asked whether it compiles.*/
