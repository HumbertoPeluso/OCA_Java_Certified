/*Up to now, all the code we’ve written in this chapter has been in the default package. This
        is a special unnamed package that you should use only for throwaway code. You can tell
        the code is in the default package, because there’s no package name. On the exam, you’ll
        see the default package used a lot to save space in code listings. In real life, always name
        your packages to avoid naming confl icts and to allow others to reuse your code.*/
