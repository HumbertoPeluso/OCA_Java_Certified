    /*you can apply access modifi ers (public, private, protected,
                                     default) to both class methods and variables. It probably comes as no surprise that you can
    also apply access modifi ers to class defi nitions, since we have been adding the public access
    modifi er to nearly every class up to now.*/


    /*The public access modifi er applied to a class indicates that it can be referenced and used
            in any class. The default package private modifi er, which is the lack of any access modifi er,
    indicates the class can be accessed only by a subclass or class within the same package.
    As you know, a Java fi le can have many classes but at most one public class. In fact, it
    may have no public class at all. One feature of using the default package private modifi er
    is that you can defi ne many classes within the same Java fi le. For example, the following
    defi nition could appear in a single Java fi le named Groundhog.java, since it contains only
    one public class:*/
