   /* When creating a new class in Java, you can defi ne the class to inherit from an existing class.
    Inheritance is the process by which the new child subclass automatically includes any
    public or protected primitives, objects, or methods defi ned in the parent class.
    For illustrative purposes, we refer to any class that inherits from another class as a child
    class, or a descendent of that class. Alternatively, we refer to the class that the child inherits
            from as the parent class, or an ancestor of the class. If child X inherits from class Y, which
            in turn inherits from class Z, then X would be considered an indirect child, or descendent,
            of class Z.
    Java supports single inheritance, by which a class may inherit from only one direct parent class. Java also supports multiple levels of inheritance, by which one class may extend
            another class, which in turn extends another class. You can extend a class any number of
            times, allowing each descendent to gain access to its ancestor’s members.
    To truly understand single inheritance, it may helpful to contrast it with multiple inheritance, by which a class may have multiple direct parents. By design, Java doesn’t support
    multiple inheritance in the language because studies have shown that multiple inheritance
    can lead to complex, often diffi cult-to-maintain code. Java does allow one exception to the
    single inheritance rule: classes may implement multiple interfaces, as you’ll see later in this
    chapter*/
