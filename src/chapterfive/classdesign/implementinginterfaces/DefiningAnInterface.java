           //include the abstract modifier in their definition. Therefore, marking an interface as
          //private, protected, or final will trigger a compiler error, since this is incompatible
         //with these assumptions. - doesnâ€™t apply to inner interfaces,
    // 5 - All nondefault methods in an interface are assumed to have the modifiers abstract
          //and public in their definition. Therefore, marking a method as private, protected,
         //or final will trigger compiler errors as these are incompatible with the abstract and
        //public keywords.
