    // 1 - A default method may only be declared within an interface and not within a class or
          //abstract class.
    // 2 - A default method must be marked with the default keyword. If a method is marked as
           //default, it must provide a method body.
    // 3 - A default method is not assumed to be static, final, or abstract, as it may be used
          //or overridden by a class that implements the interface.
    // 4 - Like all methods in an interface, a default method is assumed to be public and will not
           //compile if marked as private or protected.
